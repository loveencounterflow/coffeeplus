## Installation

* no package / package control provided so far
* manual installation only
  * git clone
  * symlink from package directory to cloned repo
  * add `"color_scheme": "Packages/coffeeplus/coffeeplus-monokai-neue.tmTheme"` in
    `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings`
* file `coffeeplus/coffeeplus-monokai-neue.sublime-color-scheme` is loaded implicitly
* it updates the color theme with backgrounds for matched regions
* adapt backgrounds to your liking


## To Do

* [ ] determine how to declare default syntax
* [ ] doc: installation
* [ ] doc: how to add language definition
* [ ] use inheritance so language region definitions get into separate file
